# sliding-window
Sliding Window is a pattern used to solve problems that requires operation in a specific window size

To identify if a problem can be solved using this pattern, we can check if :
- The problem input is a linear data structure such as a linked list, array, or string
- You’re asked to find the longest/shortest substring, subarray, or a desired value

This pattern can solve the following common problems:
- Maximum sum subarray of size ‘K’ (easy)
- Longest substring with ‘K’ distinct characters (medium)
- String anagrams (hard)
